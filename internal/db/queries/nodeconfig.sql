-- name: ListAutoSyncInbounds :many
-- Inbounds eligible for automatic node-config generation (see
-- internal/httpapi/nodeconfig.go): 'none' and 'reality' security modes are
-- always self-contained; a 'tls' inbound is included too, but only once an
-- admin has actually pasted a real certificate+key (see migration 00009) -
-- one with security='tls' and no certificate yet stays excluded, same as
-- before, rather than being pushed to nodes with no TLS material to serve.
-- The primary host (lowest id, not disabled, with a real port) supplies
-- the single back-compat listen port (`port`) for a node that predates
-- multi-port inbounds; `ports` is every distinct port of the inbound's
-- non-disabled hosts, ascending, for a node that expands one logical inbound
-- into a listener per port. Hosts can carry several rows per inbound tag,
-- and several of them may share a port - which is why `ports` is DISTINCT.
-- The primary host's `path` is the one a WebSocket/HTTPUpgrade inbound
-- answers on - the same path its clients' links carry.
